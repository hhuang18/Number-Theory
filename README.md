This is a personal project to help me and hopefully others understand some fun number theory concepts with code. The concepts included are based on class lectures and An Introduction to Number Theory with Cryptography (Second Edition) by James S. Kraft and Lawrence C. Washington.
Please reach out if you have suggestions for what number theory concept I should code next!

I've included links to proofs to any concepts I cover.

Projects:
1. Sieve of Eratostenes:

Future Projects:
1. Euclid's Algorithm
2. Modular Exponentiation
